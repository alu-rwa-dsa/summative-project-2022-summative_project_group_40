# Contributors Of the Project 

## Testimony Adeyemi
Testimony Adeyemi worked on the GUI(Graphical User Interface). Using pythonâ€™s Tkinter to build an interface where the users can input their Sudoku problem and also receive the solution

## Petronalla  Ogolla
Petronalla Ogolla  worked on The efficiency of the algorithm an analysis of the number of resources that were used in our algorithm as well as the time and space complexity our algorithm takes to produce a solution. She also worked on the User Guideline on how to  Run the program - she explicitly explained what a user needs to set up his/her Development Environment and  the Instructions to cloning and Running the project.

## Eleanor Wepngong
Eleanor worked on the project description where she was basically talking about the origin and rules to follow when playing the game. The project description also gave a reason to why there was a need for a solver and these was because most players who played the sudoku in the news players had to wait till the next day before getting the solution. She also worked on the data structures and algorithm used in the project.

## Topister Onyango
Searched the web for information. Took part in the testing phase  to check if the numbers were feasible and identified a bug which we fixed as a group. Wrote the heading solution documentation in the README.md file as well as identified the beneficiaries of the app.

## Moyosore Weke
Moyosore worked in building the algorithm for the sudoku solver, by using the backtracking algorithm and recursive data structure she was able to design an algorithm and solution that follows the rules of sudoku, whereby numbers can't occur twice in a column, row or grid, the solution also solves for any kind of sudoku.


# Contributing to Sudoklver
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting an issue
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Pull Requests
- Fork the repo and create your branch from staging.
- Avoid committing directly to the main branch. Work in a separate branch and create a pull request to add your changes to the main branch.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add some test examples.
- Ensure to describe your pull request.
- Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
- This project uses [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) as the preferred style guide to structure its code.
